<h1>The Best Movies According to Natalia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>I am Sam.</h3>
<p>This is one of the most touching films that I have in my repertoire. It's the story of a mentally handicapped man fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter. I love the story and how this man has a great capacity to love despite his mental condition.</p>
<h3>Divergent</h3>
<p>This is a pretty interesting sci-fi movie, about a world divided by factions based on virtues, pretty close to reality I'd say.</p>
<h3>The Platform</h3>
<p>Thriller and sci-fi movie, an exploration of the importance of individual initiative in driving political change that critiques both capitalism and socialism.</p>
